    "description": "Qzzr.com was a hugely rewarding and challenging project because of the dynamic needs and demands of a fast paced start up environment.  While working with Movement Ventures I took full charge of qzzr.com. I rewrote the entire website from a copy and pasted WordPress hack to clean and functional code (jade, stylus, etc.). I cowboyed and crafted all of the UI features (galleries, forms, mobile, navigation, SEO, and A / B tests) and integrated our contact forms with an integrations server (I built the server from the ground up using Node, Express, and third party API's).
