        "Memory is a major facet of human reality and is the foundation of learning. It involves transferring our experiences via encoding from working memory into long term memory. Encoding happens through organization, semantic, visual, or acoustic distinction, emotional impact, and elaboration. When information is recognized or reconstructed into experience within working memory a memory is considered to be formed. The subject of memory is divided into several parts such as declarative, implicit, episodic, haptic, echoic, visual, procedural, topographical, semantic, prospective, and retrospective memory. Memory as a process is routed through the hippocampus from the cortex to various parts of the brain. The amygdala is involved in emotional memories. Synaptic plasticity is a factor in memory either through the strengthening or weakening of synaptic activity. Stress plays a major role in weakening memory by allowing the destruction of neurons within the hippocampus."
